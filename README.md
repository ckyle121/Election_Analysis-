# Eleciton Audit of an US Congressional Precinct in Colorado 
## Overview of Project 

This project demonstrates how Python can be used to create an automated process to calculate the popular vote in elections. 

### Purpose

The election commission is looking to generate code that provides a vote count report for each candidate in each county in the precinct. By creating a general outline to report the total number of votes alongside the number of votes recieved by each candidate, the project will have the ability to be used not only for this election audit, but other elections as well. 

## Election Audit Results

## Election Audit Summary 
The election commission can use this script for any election to dislay the results of the popular vote. In a national election, the script could be modified to display state results instead of county results. In a local election, the script might be modified to display the results based on neighborhood. The code written is very easy to refashion to form a code to display the popular for any level of election.
